🚀 About Me

I’m a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 9+ years of industry experience, specializing in building and scaling production-grade AI systems across healthcare and enterprise domains.

My work spans Machine Learning, NLP, MLOps, and Generative AI, with a strong focus on LLM-based systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), model fine-tuning, and real-time AI platforms. I enjoy solving ambiguous problems where accuracy, scalability, and business impact truly matter.

I currently work on business-critical AI platforms that automate complex clinical workflows—combining rules engines, ML models, and GenAI to deliver reliable, explainable, and scalable solutions.
