# 👋 Hi, I'm Akshay

Applied AI / ML Engineer with a strong hands-on background in building, adapting, and shipping real-world machine learning and GenAI systems.

I focus on solving problems end to end — from understanding ambiguous requirements to designing, building, and deploying production-ready solutions.

---

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 9+ years of industry experience**, specializing in building and scaling **production-grade AI systems** across healthcare and enterprise domains.

My work spans **Machine Learning, NLP, MLOps, and Generative AI**, with a strong focus on **LLM-based systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), model fine-tuning, and real-time AI platforms**. I enjoy solving ambiguous problems where accuracy, scalability, and business impact truly matter.

I currently work on **business-critical AI platforms** that automate complex clinical workflows—combining **rules engines, ML models, and GenAI** to deliver reliable, explainable, and scalable solutions.

## 🔁 Adaptability & Growth

My career progression reflects continuous adaptation to new domains,
changing requirements, and evolving technical expectations.

With a strong engineering foundation, I’ve transitioned across roles and organizations
by learning what each situation demanded — new technologies, new problem spaces,
and higher ownership — and delivering under real-world constraints.

## 🧠 How I Work

I don't optimize for tools — I optimize for outcomes.

- 🔹 **Tech-agnostic by design**: Languages, frameworks, and models are tools. I choose them based on problem constraints, not comfort zones.
- 🔹 **Rapid upskilling**: I continuously learn and adapt as problem spaces evolve — from traditional ML to deep learning, GenAI, and agentic systems.
- 🔹 **Hands-on end to end**: I design architectures, write code, debug pipelines, deploy services, and optimize performance myself.
- 🔹 **Production-first mindset**: Reliability, latency, scalability, cost, and maintainability matter as much as model accuracy.

If a problem needs a new stack, I learn it.  
If it needs a simpler solution, I build that instead.

## 🔄 Learning by Building

Most repositories here started with a real problem and required me to learn something new:

- OCR & document intelligence → image preprocessing, layout analysis, text extraction
- NLP & GenAI → RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, LLM orchestration
- ML systems → model lifecycle, versioning, monitoring, CI/CD
- Backend & APIs → async services, batching, throughput optimization

Each project reflects a **learning curve**, not just a finished demo.

## 🧠 What I Work On

#### 🔹 **Production ML & AI Systems** (end-to-end ownership)
#### 🔹 **Generative AI & LLM Applications** (RAG, summarization, chatbots)
#### 🔹 **Hybrid AI Architectures** (Rules + ML + GenAI)
#### 🔹 **Real-time Decision Systems**
#### 🔹 **MLOps & Cloud-native AI** (Docker, Serverless, Azure)
